Description of JavaScript:

1. The website incorporates smooth scrolling functionality when navigating to different sections within the page. This enhances the user experience by providing a visually appealing transition between sections.

The JavaScript code targets all anchor (<a>) elements whose href attribute starts with #. When a user clicks on such a link, the script prevents the default behavior of the link and smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section within the page.

2. Certain sections of the website are designed to be clickable, providing an interactive experience for users. Currently, this includes the Quran verse section and the Donate button.

The script adds click event listeners to specific elements, Donate button within the donation form (#donation-form button). When the element is clicked, an alert message is displayed, indicating the click event. These alerts can be customized or replaced with more complex interactions as needed.
